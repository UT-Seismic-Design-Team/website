                    The University of Toronto Seismic Design Team (UTSD) is
                    comprised of both engineering and architectural
                    undergraduates who collaborate on designing, building, and
                    analyzing a scaled balsa wood model of a high rise
                    structure.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    In the annual EERI Undergraduate Seismic Design Competition
                    (SDC), the team will be judged on the structural modelâ€™s
                    seismic performance, delivery of an oral presentation,
                    poster design, architectural design and general workmanship.
                    Collectively, all of these criteria are captured in a final
                    score called the Final Annual Building Income (FABI) which
                    is used to determine the winner.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    By designing a robust yet cost effective structure, UTSD
                    team members are given an excellent hands-on opportunity to
                    learn the basic principles of structural and seismic
                    engineering in an out of classroom environment. Scroll down
                    to learn more about the team this year!
