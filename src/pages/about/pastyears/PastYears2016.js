            In our inaugural year competing in the EERI Seismic Design Competition, we learned a great deal about constructing and designing a balsa wood structure to withstand ground motions of varying intensities.
            Our design this year consisted of an integrated structural and architectural systems in order to blend into the architectural scene of San Francisco."

              A total of seven undergraduate engineering students travelled to
              San Francisco, CA to compete in the 12th Annual EERI Seismic
              Design Competition alongside top engineering schools from all over
              the world. A huge thank you goes out to UBC alumni as well as the
              graduate students from the University of Toronto for giving us a
              head start in understanding the competition and structural design!
